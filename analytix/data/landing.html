            <p>
                Your tokens will be saved to the file path you specified.
                If you did not specify a file path, you will find them in a file called "tokens.json" in your current working directory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your new tokens will serve you well for the next 7 days, unless your application status is anything other than "Testing".
                If you do not know whether your application's status is "Testing", it more than likely is.
                You can find more information regarding the lifetime of tokens on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#expiration">Google Identity documentation</a>.

                While you have been reading this, analytix has been busy pulling your report(s) down.
                You can now close this window and have a look!
