## Creating a project

To create a project:

2. On the navbar, click on the dropdown that says "Select a project".
3. Click on "NEW PROJECT".
4. Enter your project name, then click "CREATE". You do not need to set an organisation.

After this, you'll be redirected back to the dashboard. It may take some time to create the project.

## Setting up the YouTube Analytics API

3. Click "ENABLE".

### Configuring the consent screen

1. Click "Credentials" on the side bar.
2. Click "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN".
3. Select "External" from the options, then click "CREATE".

    * App name: The name of your application. This does not need to be the same as your project's name.
    * User support email: This is required even though your project will remain private to you.
    * Developer contact information: Same as User support email.
5. Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE" â€” no other information is necessary.
6. Click "ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES".

    * .../auth/yt-analytics-monetary.readonly
8. Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE".
