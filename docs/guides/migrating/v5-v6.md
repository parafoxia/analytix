# Migrating from v5.x to v6.x

This document aims to assist you in migrating from analytix v5.x to v6.0.
It does not aim to be entirely comprehensive, but instead cover the biggest changes to users.
All changed classes and methods have change descriptions in their docstrings.

!!! warning
    Version 6 is still in development.
    It is recommended you do not use it production yet.

## Authorisation

Many of the authorisation methods previously bound to the `Client` are now bound to `Tokens` instead:

* `client.token_is_valid()` ➔ `not tokens.expired`
* `client.scopes_are_sufficient()` ➔ `tokens.are_scoped_for()`
* `client.decode_id_token()` ➔ `tokens.decoded_id_token`
